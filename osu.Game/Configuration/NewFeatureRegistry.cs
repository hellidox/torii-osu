    /// Central registry of every "[NEW]" feature ID in the game. Adding

    /// The version prefix is the release the feature ships in (or the
    /// next one if it hasn't shipped yet), the suffix is a short
    /// human-readable feature name. The prefix lets you audit "what
    /// got a NEW badge in release X" with a single grep, and lets you
    /// retire stale IDs by version when cleaning up the registry.

    /// Retiring IDs
    /// ------------
    /// When a feature stops being "new" (e.g. two releases later), drop
    /// its constant from this file. The JSON file on disk will still
    /// contain a stale entry for users who'd already partially viewed
    /// the badge, but <see cref="NewFeatureTracker.ShouldShowBadge"/>
    /// will reject the unknown ID and return false, so the badge
    /// simply stops appearing. No migration needed.
    ///
    /// Adding a new entry
    /// ------------------
    /// 1. Add a <c>public const string</c> here using the version prefix
    ///    of the release the feature ships in.
    /// 2. Reference it from the badge call site by setting the host
    ///    form control's NewFeatureId init property:
    ///    <code>
    ///    new FormEnumDropdown&lt;T&gt;
    ///    {
    ///        Caption = "...",
    ///        NewFeatureId = NewFeatureRegistry.FooThing,
    ///        ...
    ///    }
    ///    </code>
    ///    The pill renders inline inside the control's caption row (to
    ///    the right of the tooltip "?" icon) and dismisses after the
    ///    user interacts with the control the threshold number of
    ///    times. Currently FormDropdown / FormEnumDropdown support
    ///    NewFeatureId; extend other form controls following the same
    ///    plumb-through pattern when a new badge call site needs them.
    /// 3. Done. The tracker will start counting interactions for the
    ///    new ID on the next app launch.
